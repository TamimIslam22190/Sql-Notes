1. Definition
Partitioning in MySQL is the process of splitting a table into multiple smaller, more manageable pieces (partitions) while still treating it as a single logical table.

Each partition can store a subset of the data based on a defined rule (range, list, hash, etc.).

2. Why We Need Partitioning
Performance improvement for large tables — queries can skip irrelevant partitions.

Efficient data management — you can drop or archive partitions without touching the rest of the table.

Better maintenance — e.g., removing old logs without deleting from the whole table.

Parallel processing — MySQL can query multiple partitions in parallel.

3. When to Use Partitioning
Use partitioning when:

Table size is huge (millions/billions of rows).

Queries often filter data by a column with a natural split (e.g., date ranges, IDs).

You need to purge old data regularly.

The dataset fits logically into chunks.

Avoid partitioning when:

The table is small — overhead might make it slower.

Your queries don’t benefit from skipping partitions.

4. RANGE Partition Example in MySQL
We will create a sales table partitioned by year.

SQL Example
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS demo_partition;
USE demo_partition;

-- Drop if exists for re-run
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS sales;

CREATE TABLE sales (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    product_name VARCHAR(50),
    sales_year INT,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    PRIMARY KEY (id, sales_year)
)
PARTITION BY RANGE (sales_year) (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (2019),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (2020),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (2021),
    PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (2022),
    PARTITION p4 VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO sales VALUES
(1, 'Laptop', 2018, 800.00),
(2, 'Phone', 2019, 500.00),
(3, 'Tablet', 2020, 300.00),
(4, 'Monitor', 2021, 150.00),
(5, 'Keyboard', 2023, 50.00);

-- Check data
SELECT * FROM sales;

-- See which partition each row is in
SELECT 
    id, product_name, sales_year, amount, 
    PARTITION_NAME
FROM information_schema.PARTITIONS
JOIN sales 
ON sales.sales_year BETWEEN 0 AND 9999
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'sales';


Expected Output (SELECT * FROM sales)
id	product_name	sales_year	amount
1	Laptop	2018	800.00
2	Phone	2019	500.00
3	Tablet	2020	300.00
4	Monitor	2021	150.00
5	Keyboard	2023	50.00

Expected Output (Partition info)
id	product_name	sales_year	amount	PARTITION_NAME
1	Laptop	2018	800.00	p0
2	Phone	2019	500.00	p1
3	Tablet	2020	300.00	p2
4	Monitor	2021	150.00	p3
5	Keyboard	2023	50.00	p4
