1. Basics of Partitioning in MySQL
Partitioning in MySQL means splitting a table into multiple physical parts (called partitions) while still treating it as a single logical table.
This can improve query performance and help with data management.

Types of partitioning in MySQL:

RANGE – Rows are stored based on a range of values in a column.

LIST – Rows are stored based on a list of discrete values.

HASH – Rows are stored based on a hash function.

KEY – Similar to HASH but uses MySQL's internal function.

2. Rules & Limitations
Partitioning is only supported for InnoDB and NDB engines.

The partition column must be part of all unique keys (including primary key).

Max 1024 partitions per table.
